# SoftwareMetrics_OOP


The below metrics are following the SOLID principles, as well as PEP guidelines. 

1. Well-commented code.
  (2) and (3) ensure that each class will have only one responsibility. 
2. One way to ensure this is minimising the number of methods for each class. 
3. Average Number Of Instance Variables per Class max 6. 
4. The number of children for a class will be maintained to no more than 5 (currently 2). 
5. Average Number of parameters for a method max. 6
6. Depth of Inheritance Tree max. 6 
7. Inheritance and methods will be used to minimise the umber of duplicated blocks of lines of code. 
8. Information hiding by using private and protected methods to hide information that should not be easily accesible/modified. 
9. Lack of Cohesion on Methods between 0 and 2 Try to split the class because it contains non-correlated methods. 
10. Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO) is a count of the number of other classes to which a class is coupled.
